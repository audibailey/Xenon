# Xenon 

Trying to emulate a serverless TamaGotchi server, similar to TatsuGotchi from Tatsumaki bot on Discord. May become a complete Discord Bot in the future.

The **planned** features:

* Tamagotchi Image Generation API
* Feeding the Tamagotchi
* Cleaning the Tamagotchi
* Playing with the Tamagotchi
* Boosters such as Gotchi-Sitter and Level Cap Transfer
* Random Tamagotchi
* Amazon Cognito and DynamoDB integration
* Discord Bot integration
* Flutter.io App integration
* Vue Web Interface integration
* (Turning it into a full featured serverless bot????)

(NB: Xenon was the first thing that popped in my head when creating the project. Unknown if it will stay.)
